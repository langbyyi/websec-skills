# Mobile Security Vulnerability Testing

> **AI LOAD INSTRUCTION**: Mobile security testing based on 100+ HackerOne public reports. Covers Android (APK decompilation, manifest analysis, exported components, Frida hooking, certificate pinning bypass, local storage extraction) and iOS (IPA analysis, URL scheme abuse, Keychain/UserDefaults data exposure, ATS bypass). Use when decompiling APKs/IPAs, testing mobile API backends, analyzing deeplinks, or performing runtime instrumentation with Frida/Drozer. Base models often treat mobile as web — mobile-specific sinks (SharedPreferences, Keychain, Content Providers, URL schemes) require distinct testing approaches.

## Task Objectives

- This skill provides mobile security vulnerability testing guidance based on HackerOne public reports
- Capabilities include:
  - Android vulnerability testing guidance (business logic flaws, component security, data storage, permission bypass, etc.)
  - iOS vulnerability testing guidance (URL schemes, deep links, data protection, API security, etc.)
  - Vulnerability case study analysis (real report technique summaries)
  - Code pattern recognition and vulnerability detection (comparison with known vulnerability patterns)
  - Tool usage guidance (Drozer, Frida, Burp Suite, etc.)
- Auto-trigger: prioritize this skill when Android/iOS/mobile projects or vulnerability scanning tasks are detected. Typical project fingerprints include APK/AAB/IPA, AndroidManifest.xml, build.gradle, Kotlin/Java Android source, Info.plist, .xcodeproj, .xcworkspace, Swift/Objective-C, React Native, Flutter, Cordova/Capacitor, Frida, Drozer, MobSF, Burp mobile interception, mobile API security testing, HackerOne mobile case analysis.

## QUICK START

### First-pass probes

| Signal | Probe | Why |
|---|---|---|
| APK available? | `jadx -d output app.apk` or `apktool d app.apk` | Decompile to review manifest, source, and resources |
| Hardcoded credentials? | `grep -r "api_key\|password\|secret\|token" output/` | Keys in source = direct leakage |
| API endpoints found? | `grep -r "http://" output/` or `grep -r "https://" output/` | Map backend attack surface |
| Certificate pinning? | Check `NetworkSecurityConfig` / `Info.plist` ATS settings | No pinning = proxy intercept all API traffic |
| Insecure data storage? | Check SharedPreferences, SQLite DB, Keychain after usage | Sensitive data stored in cleartext = local extraction |

```bash
# Quick APK triage
jadx -d ./decompiled app.apk
grep -ri "api_key\|password\|secret\|Authorization" ./decompiled/
cat ./decompiled/AndroidManifest.xml | grep -i "exported\|permission\|deeplink"
```

## Testing Workflow

### Standard Process

1. **Requirement identification and scenario matching**
   - Determine target platform (Android/iOS) or cross-platform
   - Identify vulnerability type (business logic, component security, data protection, etc.)
   - Determine query intent (learning guidance, code audit, case reference)

2. **Knowledge retrieval**
   - Android: read [android.md](android.md), locate relevant cases by keyword
   - iOS: read [IOS.md](IOS.md), locate relevant cases by keyword
   - Extract three parts from each case: "testing techniques", "technical details", "vulnerable code patterns"

3. **Analysis and guidance**
   - **Technique guidance**: provide actionable testing workflows based on case study steps
   - **Technical explanation**: explain vulnerability root cause, exploitation method, and key technical points
   - **Code pattern recognition**: compare user-provided code against known vulnerability patterns, highlight risks
   - **Tool recommendations**: recommend and guide usage of relevant security testing tools

4. **Output organization**
   - Target answers to user questions, avoid stacking unrelated cases
   - Provide specific actionable steps and commands
   - Include real case links for deep reference
   - For code analysis, clearly identify vulnerability locations and remediation suggestions

### Typical Scenarios

**Scenario A: How to find specific vulnerability types**
- Query relevant documentation, extract cases for the vulnerability type
- Summarize general testing approach and key points for that category
- Provide detailed step-by-step guidance and tool usage methods

**Scenario B: Code audit and vulnerability detection**
- Read the "vulnerable code patterns" from documentation
- Compare against user code, identify similar patterns
- Provide specific vulnerability locations and remediation suggestions

**Scenario C: HackerOne case analysis**
- Locate the corresponding case in documentation by report URL or vulnerability name
- Summarize the core testing techniques and technical highlights
- Analyze reusability of techniques in other scenarios

**Scenario D: Learning mobile security**
- Provide systematic case index by platform and vulnerability type
- Recommend learning paths from simple to complex
- Emphasize practical experience and techniques

## Resource Index

### Reference Document Structure

Each case contains three core sections:
1. **Testing techniques**: specific steps for vulnerability discovery, tool usage, analysis methodology
2. **Technical details**: attack flow, payload construction, key technical points
3. **Vulnerable code patterns**: vulnerable code examples and remediation suggestions

## Usage Examples
